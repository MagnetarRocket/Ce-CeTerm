    1. Create a file with a tab followed by text, E.G.
   	aaaa
       Make sure there is enough data to fill the screen so you can
       scroll down.
    2. ca some text, E.G. the middle two a's.
    3. Scroll down and then back up.  Make sure the color is set
       up correctly.
    4. Add enough lines above the colored line to push it off the
       screen.  Now cut those lines and make sure the color is ok
       when the line returns.  Make sure line 1 is not deleted,
       thus causing a partial redraw.

    create_data 16384 1
    With scroll bars on.
    Make sure the horizontal scroll bar works.

    In Ce (Type D)
    In any file, on one line.  Color 2 words red.  Then color
    two later words in the same line blue.  Make sure the red
    does not go away.  Execute "debug color", then add a bit of
    green completely contained in the blue area.  Then type some
    data in the green area.  Execute "debug color" and make sure the
    blue area is split.

    In Ce (Type X)
    Run the following commands, make sure the cursor does not find the
    red on line 5.
    5,6ca red

    In Ce (Type X)
    Open a file and do an xc. Then create a cc window.  In the cc window,
    do an xc and then close the first window.  Go to a different
    window and do an xc.  Try to paste in the original cc window.
    Make sure the correct data gets processed.

    In ceterm (Type X)
    Open a new ceterm. ceterm -geo 500x500-1+1
    Do an "again" on line zero, the empty first line in the transcript
    pad.  Do a pwd in the UNIX window and press enter.  Then
    go to line zero in the transcript pad and try to do an again
    on the pwd command.  Make sure the pwd is transfered.  The
    problem was the area to the left of the cursor was transfered.

    In Ce (Type D)
    Execute:
    [7,1];dr;[15,9] ca red blue
    [20,5]dr;[20,15] ca yellow green

    On the line above the yellow/green, do line deletes until the
    line moves up.  Make sure the color moves properly.
    Undo and repeat using BackSpace to the left of the green area.
    Make sure the color moves up one line properly.
  
    in ceterm (Type D)
    With scroll bar mode set to auto.
    do a few ls's to fill the screen and have the horizontal scroll bar
    off.  Then do a phone command or something with will generate wide
    output.  Make sure the scroll bar is not covering the last line
    of data when it turns on.

    --------------------------
    Parse it with ^*Home and edit the line begining with 
    <CENTER>.  Run "s/e/aaaaaaa/" on this line.  Make sure the
    colors move as appropriate.  Undo the substitute.  Put the
    cursor on the '<' at the beginning on '</H1>' and type.
    The color should be the same as the preceding word 'Page'.


    In Ceterm (Type D)
    run:
    create_data 16385 3
    Problem was pad only scrolls 3 lines and scrolling is off
    after that point.


    in Ce (Type O)
    set tabstop to  ts 25 5 -r
    Error was that this put ce into an infinite loop


    In ce (Type E)
    rm /usr/tmp/file
    ce /usr/tmp/file
    debug cclist    
    Look at the cclist, it should have a made up inode, the
    create date should be the The directory inode, and the
    size should be zero.
    From a UNIX window, ce /usr/tmp/file, the cc should be
    recognized. Telnet to another machine, ce /usr/tmp/file, the
    cc should not be recognized. Close the other node window.
    Type a few characters in /usr/tmp/file and save it.
    debug cclist
    There should be real inode, create date, and size information.
    Run ce /usr/tmp/file, the cc should be recognized.
    Close the cc window.
    Add some more characters and save.
    debug cclist
    The cclist should have a new inode.  The create date may
    have changed, The new size should be shown.
    Add some more characters and save.
    debug cclist
    The cclist should have the same inode as last time.
    ce /usr/tmp/file.  The cc should be recognized.
    

    In ce (Type P)
    In the enclosing ceterm window:
        ceopt="-cmd '$'"
        cv $ceopt ~/.profile
        (Go to top of file in first window)
        cv $ceopt ~/.profile
    Make sure the second window comes up and goes to the bottom.
    Use debug @4 to make sure the cc window message parses ok.

    In Ceterm (Type C & D)
    create a long prompt  PS1='ddddddddddddddddddddddddddd'
    Make the window so 1/2 character fits past the prompt.
    Bug was you could position the cursor so it does not shift when you
    type and the letters assemble in the window backwards.

    In ce (Type X)
    In file crpad.c with lineno on.
    Copy the following into the default paste buffer and use cmdf -p
    Make sure it creates both labels.
    lbl                 # create a label at the current position
    1                   # Go to line 1 column 1
    /main *(/;lbl main  # Find the main procedure and set label
    /static void dump_atom/;lbl dump_atom   # find routine dump_atomand set label
    glb                 # Go back where we started


    In ce (Type X)
    Set some labels with lbl and some colored areas.  Make sure that
    one of the colored areas overlaps a label.  Try 1,$dlb and make
    sure the labels go away, but the color is ok.  Then use undo to
    bring back the labels and try 1,$ca to get rid of the color and
    leave the labels.  Make sure the color overlapping the label goes
    away correctly.

    In Ce (Type X)
    Over the following C code:
    Do a rectangular mark starting just past the "  on the last
    printf line and extending UP to the 8 on the first printf line.
    This way the [ is included in the marked region.
    Press escape and execute the command: s/  *\[/='%./
    It should work went you mark from bottom left to top right
    and also for top left to bottom right.
    printf("loadid                   [8];   /* c */
    printf("module                   [31];  /* c */

    In ce (Type P)
    Turn on record.
    type "%08X\n",   (then arrow down and arrow left 8 times)
    turn record off playback
    Problem was \ got lost MSG: (es) Command syntax error - missing delimiter (5: es '\')


    In Ce (Type C)
    kd ^1 rm;echo ke
    mark a region of text and to a substitute over it which
    fails.  Then press ^1, the area should rehighlight as it
    does when you execute the commands manually.

    In Ce (Type O)

    R: r4000 cm05b 08/26/97 10:06:05 gsccofr:new_s 2.2 d ew
    Run the following line.  Make sure both lines appear in the initial display
    /bin/tail -f /tmp/ztrans | ce -name psrc11999 -readlock -transpad  -font 7x13bold -geo c58x16+510 -bg '#ffffc8' -fg black  -title 'PSRC Promote/Repoint Log' -pd n -sb n


    In Ce (Type P)
    On any file:
    Set the Xdefaults to contain:
    ce.lineno:      y
    cv.lineno:      y
    ceterm.lineno:  n
    Ce.lineno:      n
    cc the window.  Make sure line numbers are on unless the
    window as a ceterm.

    In Ce (Type P)
    create_data 10 600 > /tmp/z
    ce /tmp/z
    Put window in upper left corner
    cc
    Put new window in upper right corner and ^b
    Cut 3 lines from the left window and paste them in the right
    window.  Make sure they are drawn in their new location.
    Repeat with lineno on, make sure line numbers draw correctly.

    In Ce (Type X)
    Execute the following line on a line at least 50 characters
    long:
    [7,1],[7,9]ca red blue;[7,21],[7,23]ca red blue;[7,36],[7,39]ca red blue;
    Split the line in the middle of the center colored section.
    Undo. Redo.  Go to the end of the first line which just got
    split.  Do a character delete to rejoin the lines.  Make sure
    the color looks the same.  Do the same in the last colored
    area.
    Split the line just after the last character of the first
    colored area. The start of the new line should not be colored.
    Move right two characters on the new line and split the line.
    The two characters on a line by themselves should not change
    color. Grab a bunch of lines into a paste buffer and paste
    them at the begining, middle, and end of a colored region.
    Also, just before and after.  Make sure the results are as
    expected.
    Undo the changes back to the original line being colored.
    Split at the middle of the center colored section.  Delete
    with 'ed' the newline at the end of the line to rejoin.  Do
    this 3 times. Split one more time.  This time move the cursor
    a few characters to the right of the newline and do 'ed'.
    This does a join with padding.  Repeat substituting a cut
    (xd) for the delete (ed).

    In Ce (Type P)
    Make sure the following DM command string does not cause a
    memory fault.   It should cause error messages.
    ca blue white PS1='${HOSTNAME}:${PWD#$HOME/}> ^B^Btmw;tb;tl;ca blue white

    In Ce (Type C)
    Ce a new file, use NP9 size and position (upper right corner)
    put in one short line
    a line long enough to activate the horizontal scroll bar
    two more short lines
    Insert a line after the long line and put in a form feed "er 0c"
    Scroll down twice.  Move cursor to last line on window.  Scroll
    up twice.  Problem was program would try to reposition cursor  
    when scroll bar came on.  Since it was in the area below the
    form feed, it would scroll the window back down.

    In Ce (Type D)
    In CC mode with the cc window on another screen.
    In the place past the end of file, type a line.
    Try to type in the other window and get the line
    locked message.  Leave the cursor alone.  In the first
    window, type some more on the line and
    then break the line with an 'en'.  From the previously
    locked out screen.  Type a letter.  The problem was the
    Line that last letter got typed on got trashed.
    
    In ceterm (Type D)
    run the command
    ceterm -geo 85x25+65+0
    Make sure it does not abort.  The size was too small and caused
    a resize request from "main_subarea" before the first drawing.

    In ce (Type X)
    execute:  xl -f ztst.xl 'testing'
    Make sure file ztst.xl is created in the current working
    directory and that it contains the string 'testing'.  Note
    there should be no newline in this case.

    In ce (Type X)
    execute:  alias tst xl CLIPBOARD '"$@"' ke
              tst /this   is a  test/
    Then paste CLIPBOARD You should paste "/this" "is" "a" "test/"
    execute:  alias tst xl CLIPBOARD '"$*"' ke
              tst /this   is a  test/
    Then paste CLIPBOARD You should paste /this is a test/

    In ce (Type X)
    Set key definitions such as:
    kd `Left   ph -1  ke
    kd `Right  ph  1  ke
    Highlight one word of text on a line and color it with
    ca orange
    (any color will do)  Use the Alt-Right key to scroll over a
    few characters.  Make sure the color stays over the same word.
    Scroll back and make sure the color stays in place.

    In ceterm (Type D)
    With both horizontal and vertical scroll bars on and the
    window in the NP6 position. Use create_data 100 100 to
    create data which turns on both scroll bars.  Use the
    copy key to copy a more than one line of text and paste
    it into the UNIX command window.  Make sure the scroll bars
    position correctly.  The problem was they would draw over
    the unix window.

    In Ce (Type D)
    Scroll bars on auto.
    In a window where there is no horizontal scroll bar but the
    line just above the top of the window will cause the horizontal
    scroll bar to be turned on.  Put the cursor on the bottom line
    of the window and use Shift Up to scroll up a line at a time.
    The problem was that when the scroll bar appeared, cursor 
    repositioning moved the window down a line, which pushed the 
    window line back off which turned off the scroll bar.
    The window kind of got stuck.

    In Ce (Type X)

    The key definition deletes the number and goes to the next
    line.  When it gets to the bottom of the screen make sure
    that the data scrolls up onto the screen and numbers go away.
    The bug was that the whole line went away at the bottom of 
    the screen.

    In Ce (Type D)
    With scroll bars in auto mode.
    Geo 580x610+567+24   On a window with the 
    horizontal scroll bar not exposed.  Put the following line
    in the file:
    Col 1

    V
    			hello
    (Note the tabs)
    Put the cursor on column 0 of this line and use the
    RightS key to do a PH 20.  
    The problem was the window would scroll right and then
    jump back.

    In ce (Type X)
    Mark a region of text and color it with both background and foreground.
    Go to a short line in the colored area and position the cursor
    past the end of the line using the mouse.  Start typing. 
    Make sure the area from the end of the last line to the typing
    area colors in.

    In Ce (Type C)
    On the HP (can display back to Sun)
    With "sb -auto"
    On the first page a line is long enough to cause the
    horizontal scroll bar to exist.  Put the cursor in the middle
    of the window, press escape, do a find for something off
    screen on a window where there will be no horizontal scroll
    bar.  Drag the cursor right slowly after the find works. The
    bug was the cursor jumped to a new location.

    In Ce (Type D)
    create a new file with  "sb -auto"
    Create a few lines and copy them, then do repeated
    pastes to create more lines than fit on the window.  Make
    sure the scroll bar appears at the correct time.
    Do the same pasting process to make a line longer to trigger the
    horizontal scroll bar.

    escape back to the command window.  Execute "so" by itself.  The
    change should happen again.  Undo again.  Escape back to the
    command window and execute so/abc/.  The word else should change
    to abc.

    in Ce (Type D)
    With a cc window up on the same screen.  Leaving one window
    should release the line for typing on the other window.

    In Ceterm (Type P)
    with autoclose on.
    do a sleep 5 in the unix window, press enter and
    do a ^d (eef)
    Then move the mouse out of the window.  The window should
    come down when the shell terminates.

    In Ce (Type C)
    In a pair of unobscured windows occupying the
    top and bottom half of the machine.  Define the
    Find (F19) key to be
    kd F19 ti ke
    Make sure ti goes back and forth between the
    two windows and the box cursor stays in tact.
    Before trying this do a ce -iconic on some file.

    In Ce (Type C)
    Take the string:
    return((c = memcmp(DRAWING_DATA(m), s, sl)) ? c : (d=(ml -sl)) / ABS(d));
    and size the window so the last paren is just off screen.
    Put the cursor on the first paren and do a 'bl -d'.
    The window did not shift and the cursor was put on the
    second to the last paren.

   In Ce (Type C)
   lkd ^r //; [+3]; [-6]; [+3] ke
   with resource
   Ce.findbrdr: 2
   Do a find on something that will be found past the first
   screen and then do a ^r.  The bug was that the cursor went
   to absolute line number 3.

    In Ce (Type S)
    On the following block of text:
    Col 1

            This is a test line
            This is a test line
            This is a test line

    Highlight the block of text using normal highlighting.
    Stop the highlight in col 1 of the last line.
    Execute:
    s/%   //     (s/^   // in UNIX mode)
    The bug is that the last line changed gets shifted all the
    way to the left.

    In Ceterm (Type S)
    lkd Return tr;en;[-2];tr;/[~ ]/;[+1];es' ';[,-1];ed ke
    Unix mode:

    In Ceterm (Type D)
    execute pwd
    Do an undo in the UNIX window.  Make sure it puts the pwd
    back and leaves the number of lines in the UNIX window at
    1.
    execute la -lad .
    Move the mouse into the transcript pad to the 'p' in pwd
    and do an xc of the first pwd. Move to the
    UNIX window and paste in the pwd. The UNIX window should
    expand to 2 lines. Use arrow down (ad) to submit the line.
    Then do an undo. You should get the pwd back and the UNIX
    window should revert to 2 lines.

    In Ce (Type S)
    In a large file (80000 lines) with -noreadahead enabled:
    Using key definitions:
    kd ^KP_7  /[~a-zA-Z._@@-$0-9~`]/dr;  \[~a-zA-Z._@@-$0-9~`]\;/?/xc find_data;   tdm;tl;xd junk;es '\';xp find_data;tr;es '\';en ke

    scroll down a few pages, put the cursor over a word and
    press ^KP_7.  It should find the previous occurance of the
    word and not read in any more lines.  Problem was that it
    read to end of file.

    In Ce (Type P)
    Put in the key defintions:
    kd ^1 s/&'from: '/&'to: '/ ke
    kd ^2 s/&`from: `/&`to: `/ ke
    Over the following data:
    Col 1:
    |
    V
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaa
    Mark the range of text and try ^1 and ^2.  
    For from: use space a (leading space)
    For to: use b
    In def ^1 all the a's should change.  In def ^2
    only the first a on each line should change.
    Now back out and go in and repeat the exercise using the keydefs as
    loaded from the X server.  This resolves problems with reloading multiple
    prompt key definitions.

    In Ce (Type C)
    Do a find for a single character such as 'e'. Move the
    character so it is at the right edge of the window. Both
    just past and just inside and so the character after the e
    just starts to show. Make sure a repeat find gets the 'e'
    correctly. It should shift the window when the e is 1 char
    from the edge of the screen.

    In Ceterm (Type X)
    Turn mouse off.  Arrow up into the transcript window and
    use the again key.  The bug was that the whole line was
    copied instead of just from the cursor right.

    In Ceterm (Type C)
    In a window with a thousand lines or so in the output pad
    Start with the cursor in the Unix window.

    In a file with a form feed. Position to the page above the
    form feed. do a find on something which is on the first
    line with the form feed. back up one page and do the ^1.
    The bug was that the cursor ended up in the blank area
    past the form feed.

    In Ce (Type D)
    Define the following key:
    kd ^1 tl; es'> '; [+1] ke
    kd ^2 es'#';pp .5 ke
    Put the cursor on a non-blank line and press ^1.
    The bug was the line the cursor was on got redrawn with
    the wrong data. Put the cursor on the last line of the
    window and press ^2 The bug was the modfied line was
    trashed when it scrolled to the new position

    In Ce (Type P)
    Put in the following key definition:
    kd ^1 tl;s / *$//tl;es '~';tl;dr;/[~ @t]/xc  ai_buff;tl;ed;tr;en;tl;xp ai_buff;tl;ed;tr ke
    Go to the DM command window and just press enter.
    The bug was a bus error.

    pasted.  Repeat this exercise with the second window on
    another workstation.  In this case the first line is the
    correct one.  While the second window is up on the 
    other workstation, do a cc -display back to the original
    workstation.  Go to the original workstation and try to
    do a paste in the new window.  It should get the copy
    from the original window on that workstation.

    In ceterm (Type D)
    do a cc to a different display.
    In the other display, do an inv.  
    Only the window doing the inv should be affected.

    In Ce (Type O)
    Bring up a Ce and do a "cc -display" to another display.
    Preferably an Xstation.  Type in each window a bit and
    make sure the cursor does not disappear in either window.
    Then turn off the Xstation.  The other window should run
    for a while and then get a message about the CC window dieing.
    The session should continue.

    In a debug copy of ce on the HP (Type M)
    Bring up a file with 30000 lines of text 12 columns wide.
    Delete the first 191 lines and do a "debug dump"  the
    first data block should have header blocks to index 127
    and the first one should have one line.  Then delete the
    first line in the file and do another "debug dump".  There
    last header should now be number 126 in the first data
    block.

    in ce on the HP (Type E)
    bring up a file and cc it.  Position both windows.
    Log off saving the current sessions.  Look at the
    .vue/sessions/current/vue.session file after logging
    back on.  The -DELAY argument should be added to one
    of the cv commands.  Also, an xdmc -list should show
    that both cv windows have the same cepid.

    in ce (Type E)
    with serveral windows up.  Do an xdmc -list and
    make sure some of the windows are obscurred and/or
    icon'ed in the bits shown by xdmc

    in ceterm (Type E)
    Have serveral ceterms up.  In one window do /bin/ksh
    to start another level of shell.  Use xdmc -list to make
    sure the shell you have chosen is in the middle of the
    list.  Then do an xdmc "ex'abc'" and make sure it goes
    to the correct window.

    in ce (Type D)
    in a file with form feeds with lineno on and a cc window.
    page to where a form feed splits the window.
    move the cursor into the blank portion of the
    window past the more.  pres escape to do a tdm.
    execute es 's' and press enter.  The s should go
    in the correct place and the lines get added in both windows.
    Do the same thing in the space past end of file and
    do the same thing using the s key to do the es.

    in ce (Type X)
    With a cc window active on another display.
    1.  Type in the first window.
    2.  Try to type in the second window on the same line.
        An error should be displayed.
    3.  Go to the second window and type on the line below the
        busy line in the first window.
    4.  Go back to the first window and delete a character on
        the first window's busy line.  Everything should stay ok.
    5.  Turn on line numbers.
    6.  In the first window, add some lines above the pair of
        busy lines.  The second window should move the first 
        displayed line up to keep the busy line on the screen.
    7.  Scroll the second window down a ways and add more lines
        to the first window.  The line numbers and line number
        in the title line should change.
    8.  Type some in the second window.  In the first window mark
        a range over the second window busy line and do an XD.
        A msg should occur in both windows (different message text).
    9.  Type some in the second window.  Do a rectangular paste
        in the first window which will impact the busy line.
        The busy line should remain unchanged.

    in ce (Type P)
    for a key with bl -d under it.
    do a kd on the key for when it is loaded from the server
    and also when it was loaded by this ce.
    The displayed key definition should be the same.

    in ce (Type P)
    using the licence manager, and also without

    in ceterm (Type D)
    with -vt auto active.
    telnet to another node (activates autovt).
    start with a tall screen (like np6 geometry)
    do an ls to fill the screen
    do a geometry to shrink the screen.
    make sure typing works normally in the main window.

    in ce (Type P)
    create three empty files with touch
    touch /tmp/f1 /tmp/f2 /tmp/f3
    type ce  /tmp/f1 /tmp/f2 /tmp/f3
    The first file came up with the modified flag set.

    In ce (Type D)
    move the edit window so the dm input window is off 
    the physical screen and hit tdm.  The cursor should end
    up in the correct place.

    in ceterm (Type D)
    with autovt on, start vi on a file
    and back out of it.  Make sure vi
    comes up ok and prompt is restored when
    vi quits.

    in ce (Type M)
    load a variable width font.
    Turn on window wrap.
    scroll over a half page.
    type on the end of a line and cause a word wrap.
    Make sure the cursor is placed correctly.

    in ce  (Type D)
    load a variable width font.
    Put the cursor past the end of a line and do a rectangular
    mark.  The rectangle should behave properly.

    in ce (Type D)
    create the definition
    kd ^1 ! sort;rm;echo -r ke
    kd ^2 ! sort;rm;echo  ke
    highlight a rectangular region of text.  Put the
    ce session in read only mode and do the ^1.
    The region should rehighlight correctly.  Then try
    it with a normal region of text after modifying the.
    key definition to remove the -r from the echo.
    
    in ce (Type S & P)
    Set up the key definition
    kd ^1 s/abc/def @@&/ ke
    (Unix mode:)
    kd ^1 s/abc/def \\&/ ke
    On a line containing 'abc', this should replace the 'abc'
    with 'def abc'.
    The key defintion:
    kd ^1 s/abc/def &'hello '/ ke
    Should prompt (using prompt hello) and then replace
    'abc' with 'def <value>'. Where <value> is what was
    entered in the prompt.

    In ceterm (Type D)
    create two overlapping windows.
    In one window make the prompt long, such as:
    PS1="This is a long prompt a little long: "
    Position the other window so it overlaps the long
    prompts so the edge of the window splits one of the 
    letter l's.  Pop the non-long prompt window to
    the front and then to the back.  Watch to see if the split
    l gets distorted.  Do an rw in the long prompt window.
    See if any fields change.  Try this in the command window
    with the edge of the d in command.

    In Ce or ceterm (Type D)
    define the np2 key to make a horizontal window followed by
    a wp -t
    kd np2  geo 1200x517+0+480;wp -t ke

    Create three windows.  
    One in the np1 position, one in the np6 position, and one
    in the np8 position. The np8 window overlaps the np6
    window. Pop the np6 window to the front with a wp key.
    Then use np2 on the window in the np1 position. It should
    end up on top of the np6 window.

    In Ce (Type P & D & C)
    Start ce with
    ce -w -cmd "[0,0]ww -c 72;tl;en;au" zjunk.test
    The cursor should end up on the first character of the
    first line.

    In Ce (Type X)
    Mark a rectangular region and do a tf.
    move the cursor to a different line below the
    original mark.
    do an xc followed by an xp.
    Only the line you are on should be copied.  Bug in 2.1
    was that the mark was not cleared.

    In Ce (Type C) 
    Try the following commands:
    [5,5]    # row 5, column 5
    [5]      # row 5, no change in column (was wrong in 2.1)
    [5,]     # row 5, no change in column
    [+5]     # bump row by 5, no change in column
    [ +5,]   # bump row by 5, no change in column
    [-5]     # decrement row by 5, no change in column
    [ +1 , +1 ] # bump row and column by 1
    [,3]     # current row, column 3
    [,-4]    # current row, go left 4 columns
    [-2,-2]  # go up two rows, go left 2 columns
    []       # do not move cursor
    15       # go to line 15, column 1

    In Ce (Type C)
    start two windows and overlap them.  Pop the
    window in the back.  Make sure the cursor goes
    to the correct place.

    In ce (Type D)
    do a ce -ver to display version.
    Make sure cursor is redrawn
    Not broke in 2.1

    In ceterm (Type D)
    with autovt on.
    Telnet to another node and set the display back.
    use the DM ce command to open an edit window on the
    original host.  Make sure scrolling and other non-vt100
    commands work in the edit window.

    In ce on the Apollo (Type D)
    start ce with:
    ./ce -lineno y -geo  600x470+615+520 -font courr12 ./zjunk.test
    execute geo 600x471
    Then 472, 473, and so on until another line appears on the pad.
    The lineno number and the real line must appear at the same time.

    In ce (Type P)
    Run the keys commmand and pn the output to /tmp/keys
    in a command window run CEKEYS=/tmp/keys ce -reload
    The file should parse cleanly
    Run the keys command again and pn the output to /tmp/keys2
    diff the two files.  They should be identical.

    In ce (Type D)
    start two windows.  In one turn on debug @15 or
    use and xev window instead.  In the non-debug
    window exeute the rs command.  You should see
    expose events occur in the other window.
    

    In ceterm or ce (Type O)
    execute the DM command:
    cp -vt off "rlogin slc_14"
    (or some other node which you do not have a .rhosts file on)
    You will be prompted for the password.  Make sure that
    the password does not print and that you cannot undo
    to get to the password.
    Try the same thing with -vt auto and make sure you
    can exit the application.
    

    In ce (Type P)
    check the value of XAPPLRESDIR and in the directory
    it specifies (set it to . if necessary), create
    a file named Ce (the class name).  In this file place:
    Ce.mouse : off
    Running Ce in this directory should come up with
    mouse off.

    In ceterm on the RS6000 (Type P)
    Go to the DM input window.  Type cd /
    It should work.

    In ce (Type P)
    create a file with 11 blank lines and the chars 'abc' on
    line 12 and 12 more blank lines (blank = empty).
    on line 8  er @f
    Save the file and back out.
    ce -geo c40x11 -lineno yes <file>
    do a ^t 
    press escape to do a tdm and then do a find /abc/
    bug was that the screen shifted but the cursor was
    not positioned on the abc.

    In ce On the IBM or SUN (Type M)
    IBM: /bin/man fseek | ce
         /bin/man fseek | ce -man
    SUN: /usr/ucb/man fseek | ce
         /usr/ucb/man fseek | ce -man
    Verify control characters are removed in one case but
    not the other.

    In ceterm (Type M)
    running ceterm without -man and with -man
    ex <any_file>
    Verify control characters are removed in one case but
    not the other.

    In ce (Type S)
    the following regular expression
    s/{[~ ]*}[ ]*/@1@n/ 
    should put each word in the marked range
    on its own line with a blank line after
    each original line.
    The bug was an infinte loop.

    In ce (Type S)
    the following regular expression
    s/{?*}/   case "@1"/
    Should match from the current cursor position to the end of line
    and put that data in a case statement.

    In ce (Type S)
    execute
    1,$s/@n@n/@n/
    This should compress multiple null lines to half as many lines.
    1,$s/% *@n//
    Every pair of empty lines should become a single null line.
    Every empty line by itself goes away.


    In ceterm/ce on the sun (Type O)
    bring up a ceterm.
    From the dm window of this ceterm, fire up a ce.
    Use the window manager to quit the ce session (not ^n).
    The bug was that the shell in the ceterm died.

    in ce (Type X)
    in a file with tabs
    mark a rectangular region after the first tab.
    Verify that what is marked is what is copied.
    Ex: copy from "char" on the 3b line to "=" on the 3e line.
    Paste to verify.
    col 1
    |
    |char 0x3A = ':'
    |			char 0x3B = ';'
    |char 0x3C =	 '<'
    |char 0x3D = '='
    |ch			ar 0x3E = '>'
    |char 0x3F = '?'

    in ceterm on the sun (Type X)
    Go into hold mode.  Put three lines of data in the Unix
    command window.  Rectangular highlight a piece.  Do a ph 1.
    The box should remain intact.  The bug trashes the
    rectangle.  Window refresh (rw) also messes things up.

    in ce (Type X)
    Do an xc on a line. Then do an xc -A on the line. Then do
    a xp. There should be 2. copies of the line pasted. The
    bug was -a option did not work for X paste buffers. grab a
    word. Then grab a word by marking it and doing an xc -a,
    then do an xp. Both words should paste. Do it again
    grabbing the first word in one window and the second in
    another window. It still paste both windows. Also, copy
    the first word in one window and then close the window.
    Then xc -a the second word in another window. The paste
    should paste both words.

    in ceterm (ACR 6369) (Type O)
    First try to do a pw.  An error should be printed telling
    you to name the pad with 'pn' first.  Then do a pn and
    close the window.  The new name should stick (not revert
    to <stdin> and the pad be saved as a file.

    in ce (Type S)
    Verify correction of the following bug.  The command
    \?\
    searches backward for "any single character except
    newline". claimed most of the time except when the cursor
    is on the first or second column of a line, then it jumps
    2 lines backward!!

    in ceterm (Type C)
    When the window is moved with the numeric pad keys, the cursor
    should go to the Unix commmand window. If you resize or move
    with the window manager area, the cursor should not warp
    anywhere.

    in ce (Type C)
    Create a file with a form feed 5 lines from the bottom of
    the file. The file should be 150 lines long or so, so
    that it is more than one window long. Two lines above the
    form feed, put the string "abcde". Then go to the top of
    the file and do a find on abcde. The cursor should be
    positioned correcty.

    in ce (Type P)
    from the DM command window
    enter the command:
    cv ~/.profile ~/.Xdefaults
    Two new windows should pop up.

    In ce. (Type P)
    fl *-14-*
    fl
    Make sure the full name of the font shows up.

    search errors: 11/30/93
      s/@n/5/ -> cursor placement is off
      22,25s/'@n/5/ does not join lines

    in ce (Type D)
    start two ce sessions with the same geometry one right
    after another.  When the lower session is unobscurred, the
    window should be drawn properly.  The bug was that the lower
    session did not redraw the 'command:'

    in ce (Type D)
    in the dm command window
    define the key
    kd ^1 er 09 ke
    type "12345"
    positon the cursor box over the 3
    press ^1,  a tab should be inserted

    in ce on the Sun (Type S)
    in a file with the following two lines
    char 0x85 = ''
    char 0xA5 = ''
    fl -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--18-180-75-75-m-110-iso8859-1
    With an iso font loaded which has all the special Euopean
    characters.  With case sensitivity set to off.  Define 
    kd ^1 er a5 ke
    This will make ^1 type in a yen symbol.
    do a find on the yen symbol.  It should not find the 0x85
    which is the upper case equivilant (x20 masked out) of the
    yen symbol.

    In ce. (Type D)
    In a file longer than the window, with the window partially
    off the edge of the display.
    Go to the bottom of the file.
    escape to the dm window, enter pt
    The pt should work normally.  Bug was that the screen would return to
    it's original position.

    do a kd on F2S.  Bug was, the program memory faulted.

    in ce (Type D)
    mark a rectangular region. pop the window down. then
    pop it back up.  the marking should remain rectangular.

    in ce from Apollo Change Request 6303: (Type S)
    execute /@n/, it should find the end of the line.
    execute /[@n]/, it should also find the end of the line.

    in Ce. (Type S)
    tr to the end of a line where three lines have the same
    length.  do a rectangular mark (dr;echo -r).
    move right and down.  Do a cut.  The bug was a printed error
    message and the cut did the wrong thing.  Then do a 
    regular rectangular mark region and a cut.

    in Ce (Type P)
    Add some resources to the .Xdefaults under an arbitrary name like pogo.
    for example pogo.geometry : 100x100+100+100
    xrdb -load .Xdefaults
    ce -name pogo -lineno yes
    The geometry should be picked up for pogo.  Line numbers should be
    on per the command line and Ce. class options should be picked up
    from the .Xdefaults.

    In ceterm (Type P)
    Under vt mode, try to do a ph in the main window by:    
    1.  Using the horizontal scroll key
    2.  tdm to the dm window and type the ph command
    3.  Slide the cursor with the mouse to the dm window and type the
    ph command.  These should all fail.

   start a new window.  Remove several .o files from crpad
   directory and start a make.  Icon the window and let at least one
   compile complete.  Un-icon the window.  The window should look proper.
   Problem was that the data was scrolled off screen and line numbers
   were garbage.
   
   in ceterm on the hp.
   go into vt mode and run xdb crpad.
   The messages should come up the same way as in an hpterm including the

     window should scroll, not the DM input window.

     Do a help key, or some other prompt and make sure the cursor
     gets positioned correctly.  Do this with an empty DM input
     window and also with junk on the line.

    In any file, highlight text across zero length lines.

    When prompted enter xyz

    In any file which is wider and taller than the window.
    Verify workings of rectangular highlight when base
    point (marked point) is off each different side of the
    screen.  That is mark a rectangular region and scroll the 
    base point off each side and corner of the screen.  This
    is 8 different places:  1 | 2 | 3
                           -----------
                            4 |   | 5

    press ^n (wc -q).  DM input prompt should scroll to position
    cursor.

    In any file,
    'ee' in overstrike mode should replace deleted char with a blank

    a null response to "File modified; okay to quit?"
    should be the same as answering no.

    In any file.
    'en' in overstrike should replace the character under the cursor [STYMA]

    In any file, ro -on makes the file read only if possible. 
    ro -off makes it read/write.

    In any file, sc -on should turn case sensitivity on.
    sc -off should turn it off (case insensitive).

    In any file,
    'rs' should accept -f, -n, and -o for upward compatibility
    The screen is refreshed, the parms are ignored.

    In any file, try twb, No parms should give an error.
    twb should REQUIRE one of -t, -b, -l, -r

    If text is cut from tail of file,
    make sure the area where the text was shows up as
    null lines when highlighted.

    In any file, go to the bottom of the file (^b) and
    repeat 'pv 1' at bottom of file.  File should scroll up
    till only one line is shown and stay that way.

    In any file, execute the dm cmd line.
    lineno;lineno
    The lineno should toggle back to where it is.

    In ce
    do a ^b.  Press enter.  Each press of enter should
    scroll one line to keep the line you want to type on on the screen.

    In ce.
    In any file.  enter some text via
    tdm key
    es 'abc'
    enter.
    Make sure undo undoes the abc but no more.

    Make sure high lighting adjusts pixel lengths on left and right scrolls.

    In ce.
    In any file.  verify that
    on copy/paste operations, 0-length lines are not lost.  That is
    copy a range of text with zero length lines embedded, paste it.
    The null lines should get pasted.

    upon invocation, if mouse cursor is not in edit window and any
    key is hit, a core dump is taken. This is for a machine with
    explicit pointer focus.

    after mouse cursor has been in window, if it is moved out and
    text typed, the first character appears at line 0 (no kidding),
    and subsequent text is inserted at a vertical displacement equal
    to that of the mouse cursor when it was outside the window. THis
    is for a machine with explicit pointer focus.

    if an area is highlighted, and the cursor is put in the Command:
    window, and backspace is pressed into the left margin, the
    highlight is lost, until the mouse cursor is moved into the text
    area, at which point the original end-of-highlight-area point is
    lost

    '//' (repeat search) dumps if no previous pattern (unless at eof), and
    '\\' (backward search) dumps if no previous pattern (unless at bof)

    /@@/ should find an at sign.

    Go into a file.  somewhere in the middle of a line
    type abc.  then press <esc> (tdm) and do \abc\.
    The new text should be found.

    
    s/%/abc/
    should put abc at the front of each line it affects.
    Do this in a highlighted region, rectangular and regular.
    put the cursor in col 1 and do it without hightlight.
    Do it 1,5s/%/abc/
    This is aegis mode.

    Make sure highlighting is turned off for an 's' command
    for both success and failure when doing it over a highlighted
    region.  Do this for small and >512 line highlights.

    there is a problem with the mouse cursor after s-and-s success - it
    sometimes ends up outside the window instead of it being with the
    text cursor at the bottom of the highlighted area.

    make sure a single command line (or key def) that does 'pt;tt;tl' 
    (i.e. go to the top) positions the cursor properly

   Do a s/a/b/ on a line with an a on it.
   Move the cursor to a line with another a on it.
   do s
   This should change the a's to b's on the new lijne
   do s/// 
   This should delete the a'a
   Then do undo's, the undos should each
   undo all the data on a line.

    Do a rectangular copy in a file.
    Go to the bottom and page up.  paste Rectangular and also
    regular into the empty area past eof.

     in a file of ten character 1's by 20 lines.
     on HP720 - 1,$s/1/0/ changes only first char in file, again, and
     changes all but first line.  [PLYLERK]

    Resize a window and watch for mouse droppings.
    Do this in highlight and non-higlight and
    rectangular highlight modes.

    In any file do
    1,$s/@n/a/   

    In aegis mode,
    search for /?@{/
    This should find any character followed by a {

    In any file, do
    1,$so/a/b/
    then do
    so
    It should find and change a second a on the line
    or say not found.

    ph 200000000;es 'd' memfaults
    In any file, 
    ph 200000000;es 'd' 
    It should say line too long.

    Create a file with 40000 lines of data.
    do a 1,$xd.
    Then undo the change and then redo it.
    It should not memory fault and the line count
    should be good.  Then do a search for something which
    will not be found.  Then start at the bottom and do
    a backward search for something which will not be found.
